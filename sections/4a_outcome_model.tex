\section{Outcome modelling}

\subsection{Modified Rankin scale}

We used modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months as a measure of outcome. mRS is the instrument most commonly used to describe the functional outcome post-stroke \cite{quinn_functional_2009}, describing the independence of living on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 5 (severe disability requiring constant nursing attention), with death assigned an mRS of 6. A commonly used surrogate for independent living is mRS 0-2. The health utility values for each mRS level were taken from Wang \textit{et al.} \cite{wang_utility-weighted_2020}. These were 0.0, -0.19, 0.20, 0.55, 0.74, 0.88 and 0.97 for mRS 0-6. The mean mRS score, the mean utility, and the proportion of patients with mRS 0-2 in a given mRS distribution can be compared between scenarios. Table \ref{tab:mrs} shows a description of each mRS category.

\subsection{Treatment of ischaemic stroke}

Reperfusion treatment aims to restore blood flow after an ischaemic stroke. There are two potential reperfusion treatments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Thrombolysis} (also known as intravenous thrombolysis, IVT) is a medical therapy in which clot-busting drugs are used to reduce or remove the blood clot. It is potentially of use in both nLVO and LVO.
    
    \item \textit{Thrombectomy} (also known as mechanical thrombectomy, MT) is the physical removal of a clot, by a mesh device under image guidance. Thrombectomy is suitable only for clots in a large vessel (these generally cause the worst strokes). It is potentially of use in LVO.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Outcome modelling overview}

Detailed methods and code used for modelling these outcomes are available \cite{github2}, with methods described as an online book \cite{github3}. The outcome model is available as a PyPI package for Python \cite{pypi}.

We used modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3-6 months as a measure of outcome. mRS is the most commonly used instrument to describe post-stroke functional outcome \cite{quinn_functional_2009}, describing independence of living from a scale of 0 (no disability) through to 5 (severe disability requiring constant nursing attention), with death assigned an mRS of 6. A commonly used surrogate for independent living is  mRS 0-2. Health utility values for each mRS level were taken from Wang \textit{et al.} \cite{wang_utility-weighted_2020}. The mean mRS score, mean utility and proportion of patients with mRS 0-2 in a given mRS distribution can be compared between scenarios.

We calculated the patients mRS outcome distribution based on time to treatment for three patient-treatment cohorts: nLVO treated with IVT; LVO treated with IVT alone; and LVO treated with IVT and MT. For each patient-treatment cohort we calculated an mRS distribution for treatment at any given time by interpolating between the mRS distribution for treatment given at \emph{t=0} (time of stroke onset) and the mRS distribution for treatment given at \emph{t=No Effect} (time of no effect of treatment), assuming that log odds fall linearly over time \cite{emberson_effect_2014, fransen_time_2016}.

The time to no effect was 6.3 hours for IVT \cite{emberson_effect_2014} and 8.0 hours for MT \cite{ fransen_time_2016}. Our model did not include selection of patients who may still benefit from treatment beyond these durations through the use of perfusion scanning. This number is small for IVT, but is more substantial for MT â€“ approximately 2,500 per annum in England. 

The model synthesises data from multiple sources (figure \ref{fig:data_cauldron}) including reperfusion treatment clinical trials and national stroke audit data for England and Wales. Predictions from the combined model are then compared against original clinical trials and other models. Details of how these data are synthesised are given in the sections below.

The model results in mRS probability distributions for nLVO treated with IVT and LVO treated with IVT or MT (Figure \ref{fig:probs_with_time}).

\subsection{Derivation of mRS distributions from reference data}

\subsubsection{Plain English summary}

When we predict the outcome of a person who has had a stroke, we want to be able to say what is the likely improvement in disability level they would experience due to the treatment.

The modified Rankin Scale is used to assign a level of disability to a patient who has had a stroke. When looking at the mRS scores of a whole population, some scores are more likely to occur than others depending on who is included in that population. The improvement in disability level they can get will depend on the time from when their stroke symptoms began and when they receive treatment. The best possible outcome would be if they were treated immediately after they had their stroke. The benefit of treatment reduces over time until the treatment no longer offers any benefit, and they will not be better off than having no treatment. We can look at the proportion of people with each mRS score as the \emph{probability} of having that mRS score.

The main aim of the stroke outcome model is to be able to predict the range of mRS scores of various different populations. We would like to know the expected mRS scores of groups of people before a stroke, people who received no treatment for their stroke, and people who were treated at any chosen time after their stroke began. There is no real-life data for this last group of people. However we can create a model that creates that data by combining other real-life datasets. The real-life datasets come from various clinical trials.

We assume that the mRS scores of people after stroke depend on their time to treatment. The more time that passes between the start of the stroke and the treatment, the more likely it is that people will have higher disability scores. This continues up until a \emph{time of no effect} where the patients cannot benefit from the treatment but still run the risks of death due to the treatment.

This document shows how to combine the real-life datasets to create mRS distributions that will be used everywhere in the stroke outcome model.

The final datasets will cover these three main groups of people:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Patients with a non-Large-Vessel Occlusion (nLVO) who were treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT).
    \item Patients with a Large-Vessel Occlusion (LVO) who were treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT).
    \item Patients with a Large-Vessel Occlusion (LVO) who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General method}


The steps to create the mRS distributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the mRS distributions of populations before their stroke.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These data are available in the SSNAP data.
        \item We split the full cohort of patients into nLVO and LVO based on their NIHSS score (using NIHSS 11+ as a surrogate indicator of a large vessel occlusion stroke).
    \end{itemize}
     \item Find the mRS distributions of populations that received no treatment.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This data is available for two groups. The first group is patients with LVOs. The second group is a mix of patients with nLVOs and patients with LVOs.
        \item We combine the groups and infer the distribution for the population patients with nLVO (as nLVO-specific data is not available).
    \end{itemize}
        \item Find the mRS distributions of populations that were treated after the time of no effect.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At the time of no effect, we assume that patients given the treatment will see no benefit but are still exposed to a risk of death from treatment.
    \item We take the distributions for populations that received no treatment and adjust them for this predicted death rate in the absence of beneficial tratement effect.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Find the mRS distributions of populations that were treated at time zero.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For IVT:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We take reference data points for mRS $\leq$ 1 at time zero and the mRS distributions at the time of no effect. Plugging these into a formula for the changing probability of the mRS $\leq$ 1 score with time lets us find the probability distributions at time zero.
            \item Fixing this point, we take a weighted combination of the pre-stroke and no-effect distributions so that the combination's mRS $\leq$ point matches the fixed point.
        \end{itemize}     
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For MT:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Define the time-zero distribution as a weighted combination of 75\% of the pre-stroke distribution and 25\% of the no-effect distribution.
            \item Adjust the excess death rate until the mRS distribution at a reference data time matches the mortality rate at that reference time. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}    
\end{enumerate}
